# Hypothesis-testing
  Q1) A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.

Q2)A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch.
   
  Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.

Q4)TeleCall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain %  of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective and has to be reworked before processing.  The manager wants to check whether the defective %  varies by centre. Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences
